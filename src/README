Hi,

Here is a small example of game Tetri$
using SDL, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer, and SDL_image.

Sources are cross-platform and builds and runs
on Windows and Linux.
(use makefile to build on Linux)
((MUST have SDL, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer, SDL_image installed via Package Manager))


Any problems then just email me at SLNTHERO@aol.com
Enjoy!
